# SymptomCheckerApplication
An intelligent symptom analysis tool built using Groq, LangChain, and Streamlit, designed to provide users with potential medical conditions, confidence levels, and actionable advice based on user-reported symptoms.
Features üöÄ
Symptom Analysis: Enter symptoms like "I have a headache and feel fatigued for two days" and receive potential conditions and advice.
Confidence Levels: Outputs categorized as low, medium, or high confidence to help users understand the likelihood of each condition.
Actionable Advice: Clear next steps tailored to each condition (e.g., rest, hydration, or seeking medical attention).
Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è
Backend:
Groq AI: For intelligent, real-time medical condition suggestions.
LangChain: To manage and process AI workflows effectively.
Frontend:
Streamlit: For building an interactive and visually appealing web application.
How It Works üîç
Users input their symptoms in plain text (e.g., "I have a persistent cough and shortness of breath.").
The input is processed using LangChain with a custom prompt template to interact with the Groq AI model.
The AI generates:
Potential conditions.
Confidence levels (low, medium, high).
Actionable advice for each condition.
Results are displayed dynamically with a clean, color-coded interface.
Future Enhancements üåü
Multi-Language Support: Expand the app to support multiple languages for global accessibility.
Feedback Loop: Add a feature for users to provide feedback on accuracy.
Chronic Condition Management: Integrate features for tracking and managing chronic conditions over time.
Improved Visualization: Add charts or graphs to display condition likelihood dynamically.
